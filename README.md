# scripts
a collection of some simple scripts

The content of the repository is not rocket science and I am pretty sure someone somewhere can do it better, faster and smarter!
So don't complain about the fact that most of the suff isn't as perfect as the script from random genius number 2034.If on the other hand maybe someone needs a little script without inventing the wheel feel free to use the stuff I put on here. I don't put on a licence on here because you maybe find this in x variations if you google it anyway. At least be so kind and keep a reference to me in the script if you modify it.

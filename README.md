# scripts
a collection of some simple scripts

The content of the repository is not rocket science and I am pretty sure someone, somewhere can do it better, faster and smarter!
So don't complain about the fact that most of the suff isn't as perfect as the script from random genius number 2034. If, on the other hand, someone needs a little script without inventing the wheel then feel free what's on here. I don't put it under a licence because you can find x variations of it on google anyway. At least be so kind and keep a reference to me in your modified versions.
